# Inspection of Models

In order to visualize and investigate the models, the [FME Data Inspector](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_QuickTranslator/DataInspector/AboutTheDataInspector/FMEDataInspector_about.htm) or the free [FKZViewer](https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/1648.php) can be useful.

The FME Inspector also supports read-in and visualization of point clouds combined with the CityGML dataset.

Moreover, the transformed OpenDRIVE datasets can be compared with models from other data sources, such as LoD2 building models in this example.

Also, the models can be further enhanced by combining them with [LoD3 road space models](https://github.com/savenow/lod3-road-space-models).
